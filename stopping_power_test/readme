STOPPING POWER TEST

Aim: to test whether modifying the I-value of materials in Gate changes the stopping power

1) Measure proton range in water
2) Measure proton range in polyethylene
3) Determine Relative Stopping Power of polyethylene to water
4) Modify I-value of water to polyethylene RSP and measure proton range
